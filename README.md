# EDA Using SQL

This repo contains files named "Assignment 2" as well as "eda-practice", which is an assignment from my **AI & ML** course, and a self-practice of basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the "students" table - for learning and understanding the SQL queries.

This repo shows my work for learning and applying SQL. If you'd like to copy this or give me suggestions, please make a pull request!
